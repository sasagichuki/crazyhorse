# Introduction
Charts tell the story of information. They make abstract data complete; give us an intuitive grasp of patterns; and help us identify trends, make comparisons, and track progress.

# Usage
To tell the story of the data you're presenting, you need to choose the chart that most clearly presents the main insight you want to share. Use the wrong chart type, and you risk misrepresenting the underlying dataâ€”and confusing or even misleading your audience.
