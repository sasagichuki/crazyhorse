# Icons
Icons are a dynamic method of communication that creates a meaningful connection between a brand and its customers.

We use this visual language to express our personality and befriend our customers even before they sign up, but also to add clarity to ideas and highlight important features. In an effort to maintain our personality and preserve brand strength, there are some guidelines to creating our illustrations.


- Artwork is created at 2x for retina displays
- All spacing is determined by multiples of four
- Shapes are created at dimensions of multiples of four (i.e. 60 x 24)
- Spacing should be symmetrically consistent (i.e. object padding, vertical/horizontal relation, etc)


All Atlas icons are built on a 24px grid. In order to maintain visual consistency, they should be positioned within the grid in a congruent way. There are two main sizes of icons, Primary and Navigation, each with a designated content area. As a general rule, icons should never exceed the boundaries of the content area.

# Stroke, Corner Radius and Spacing
Stylistic consistency is key to a cohesive icon family. Follow these guidelines to avoid any standouts.

# Strokes
Itâ€™s important to create a visual experience that feels like Atlas, no matter where the user is on the site or in the app. Therefore, guidelines must be followed to ensure that the illustrations are stylistically cohesive.
