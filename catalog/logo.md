# Logo
The d.light logo is the most immediate representation of our company, our culture and our brand and should be used consistently in the proper, approved forms. These guidelines will help you determine the best way to use it.

### Spacing

The logo must always be surrounded by open space, free from any other element. The minimum spacing is equivalent to the height of the capital “H” in d.light on all four sides.
