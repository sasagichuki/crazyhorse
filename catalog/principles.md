In General this design system is trying to solve for the use cases that Atlas faces most commonly

    - Search through lists
    - Displaying results
    - Filtering search results
#### 3. Forms
    - Displaying information
    - Wizards and Steppers
    - Editing information
#### 4. Taking actions on items


This is an evolving and growing design guideline and system

The platform is in the middle of an open redesign, so please bear in mind that this site is currently a work-in-progress.

We created this design system with several goals in mind:

* To document the patterns we use, using our shared vocabulary
* To ensure consistency in how we use patterns and UI elements
* To provide guidance on correct usage of the patterns
* To encourage re-use of code, reducing redundancy to a minimum

This guide's goal is to create familiarity and strengthen intuition by applying the same solution to the same problem across multiple page types.
