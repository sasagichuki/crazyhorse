**Introduction**
#### Design has the power to do incredible things for people, especially when it’s clear, concise and consistent. This Atlas guide helps us build a consistent experience that is delightful.

This style guide is our brand’s playbook: a way of presenting people with a polished brand experience in all facets, but also a way to empower members of the d.light Atlas team to move quickly and do excellent work.

**The New face of Atlas**

The Atlas Design System enables you to build rich experiences and custom interfaces with the patterns and established best practices that are aligned with the d.light Brand.

This Design System includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with the d.light principles, design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience, interactions, and flows.

These patterns and components provide a unified language and consistent look and feel when designing apps and interfaces.

At Opendoor we first focused on building a system that’s scalable. We’re launching new markets left and right, and we’re always evolving our product offerings, so we need to ensure that the system we created doesn’t break or become unwieldy as we grow. We’re also very focused on usability. We broke down the things that make us Opendoor into practical applications wherever we could. For color, that meant indicating the ideal ratios of our brand colors in our work. For writing, that meant explaining how and when it was okay to deviate from the core brand voice.

If there’s one thing we’ve learned from the process, it’s that no design system is truly final, especially in a company that is evolving so quickly. The reality is that we’re constantly reinventing the way we express our brand. At a high level, our system is broken down into logo and symbol best practices, typography, color, voice and tone, photography, illustration, and motion. Keep an eye on our Dribbble to see more!
