### The New face of Atlas


Design has the power to do incredible things for people, especially when it’s clear, concise and consistent. This Atlas guide helps us build a consistent experience that is delightful.

This style guide is our brand’s playbook: a way of presenting people with a polished brand experience in all facets, but also a way to empower members of the d.light Atlas team to move quickly and do excellent work.

The Atlas Design System enables you to build rich experiences and custom interfaces with the patterns and established best practices that are aligned with the d.light Brand.

This Design System includes the resources to create user interfaces consistent with the d.light principles, design language, and best practices. Rather than focusing on pixels, developers can focus on application logic, while designers can focus on user experience, interactions, and flows.

These patterns and components provide a unified language and consistent look and feel when designing apps and interfaces.
